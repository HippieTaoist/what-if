// ## `group-sizes.js`

// Lets say we have a class of students that we want to separate into groups of three. Inevitably, if there are leftover students, we may need to have some groups of two. A group of one is not something that we want.

// **Example 1:** if we have a class size of 15, we would create 5 groups of 3 and 0 groups of 2 
// **Example 2:** if we have a class size of 16, we would create 4 groups of 3 and 2 groups of 2
// **Example 3:** if we have a class size of 17, we would create 5 groups of 3 and 1 group of 2

// Write a program that prompts the user for a class size, then logs out the number of groups of 3 the number of groups of 2 that the class would be divided into.
